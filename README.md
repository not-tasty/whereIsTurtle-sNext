# whereIsTurtle-sNext
A simple implementation of manipulating turtlesim_node, the implementation is to reach each task point (x, y) sequentially, and the program will end after traversing all the task points.

run turtlesim
```
rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
```

After you compile(katkin or whatever) the program, run this:
```
rosrun <your package name> talker
```
